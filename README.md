# swerve-rl

Notable files

Enviroment with a simple swerve sim is in swerve_env/swerve_env,
Install the package to your envrioment with
```cd swerve_env``` and ```pip install -e .```

According to [rl_picker](https://rl-picker.github.io/) [DSAC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.02811) (also a later version of that paper) is a good algorithm for this problem, although for simplicty I am starting out with regaular SAC because its already integrated with stable baselines3 and rl-zoo. 

TODO:
- add conda/requirments file
